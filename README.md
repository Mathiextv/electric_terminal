Electric charging stations come in several models. 

There are 4 different models, each with 3 screens.

What's more, you'll find 2 unlocked files: one bollard and one screen. 

You'll be able to place your own location.

All you have to do is redo the Ymap file and manifest.


Here are all the predefined positions :

coords = {x = -832.720, y = -2325.99, z = 13.656},
coords = {x = -1711.45, y = -924.994, z = 6.68},
